NetPaper
===========

Fork of Paper 1.8.8 designed for Java 11 which includes a built-in slf4j binding. Unlike other forks, NetPaper is oriented toward developers. Say goodbye to JUL logging. Embrace Java 11 features.




How To (Server Admins)
------
Download a copy of Paperclip.jar from our buildserver here:
https://ci.destroystokyo.com/job/PaperSpigot/

Run the PaperClip jar directly from your server. Just like old times

NetPaper is designed for **JDK 11** or above. Do not complain if you use it on Java 8 and experience errors.


How To (Compiling From Source)
------
To compile NetPaper, you need JDK 11, git, maven, and an internet connection.

Clone this repo using git and run ./build.sh from *bash*. The server JAR will be in PaperSpigot-Server/target/NetPaper.jar.

Special Thanks To:
-------------

* The netty developers. Minecraft relies on netty's fast performance.
* PaperMC of course! For making PaperSpigot to begin with.
